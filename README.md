# Tea App Checker ☕🔎

**Tea App Checker** is a privacy-first service that helps people **discreetly check whether they’re mentioned on the Tea app** and receive a **verified outcome report**, typically within **24 hours**.

🌐 Website: https://teaappchecker.com

> If you’ve ever wondered “Was I posted?” but don’t have access (or don’t want to use) the app directly, Tea App Checker is built for clarity and peace of mind.

## What it does

Tea App Checker provides a clear result based on submitted identifiers (e.g., name, handle, photo, city, age range).

Possible outcomes include:

- ✅ **Found** — a match was found and a report is delivered (with redacted evidence when available)
- ❌ **Not Found** — no matching record was found based on the provided details
- ⚠️ **Possible Match** — something *might* match, and the report explains what aligns and what doesn’t

## How it works

1. Submit your info on the website (only what you’re comfortable sharing)
2. Checkout via one-time payment
3. Receive a private report by email

## Why this exists

Apps that enable anonymous or semi-anonymous “reviews” can cause real anxiety and reputational harm. Many people can’t easily check what’s being said (or don’t want to create an account and go hunting). This project is designed to be:

- **Discreet**
- **Evidence-based**
- **Transparent about uncertainty**
- **Privacy-first**

## Privacy & responsible use

This project operates in a sensitive space. Tea App Checker is intended for **personal reputation awareness** and **peace of mind**, not harassment.

Please do **not** use it to:
- target or threaten anyone
- dox users or share personal information publicly
- engage in stalking, intimidation, or abuse

We aim to minimize retention of sensitive data and only use submitted details for the purpose of fulfilling the request.
